### Elevating Math Fluency Through Precision and Speed

AltairEagle is an interactive educational platform designed to help students increase their math fluency. By focusing on speed and accuracy with basic arithmetic, it builds the mental muscle memory needed for more complex mathematics like algebra, calculus, and beyond.

## Overview
Many students struggle with higher-level math not because they lack logic, but because they are slowed down by basic calculations. AltairEagle removes that friction. Named after one of the brightest stars in the sky, our mission is to provide a guiding light for learners to sharpen their foundational skills.

Through a series of timed challenges and adaptive drills, AltairEagle ensures that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division become second nature.

## Key Features
* Adaptive Drills: The system identifies which math facts you struggle with and reinforces them more frequently.
* Speed Tracking: Real-time feedback on seconds-per-problem to encourage rapid recall.
* Streak System: Gamified rewards for daily practice to keep students engaged.
* Distraction-Free UI: A clean, minimalist interface designed to keep the focus entirely on the numbers.
* Offline Ready: Built to be lightweight and accessible even on slow connections.

## The Philosophy
We believe in Automacity. 

> "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things." — Henri Poincare

Before a student can appreciate the art of math, they must master the language. By building muscle memory in the early stages, AltairEagle frees up cognitive space for the problem-solving and critical thinking required in advanced STEM fields.
